## How This Relates to Production Systems

This implementation will demonstrate core concepts found in distributed data systems like:

1. **Apache Parquet** - Block-based columnar storage format
2. **HDFS** - Distributed file system with data locality
3. **Spark** - Distributed execution engine
4. **Delta Lake** - Transactional layer on distributed storage

While simplified, this implementation will provide insights into how these systems handle:
- Data distribution and locality
- Fault tolerance and recovery
- Distributed transaction coordination
- Split-based parallel processing

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with Phase 1 to get the splittable format working locally
2. Move to Phase 2 to distribute processing across nodes
3. Add fault tolerance in Phase 3 
4. Optimize performance in Phase 4
5. Complete the system with user-facing APIs in Phase 5
6. Finalize with documentation and testing in Phase 6

This incremental approach ensures that each component is solid before building the next layer of complexity.
