# DeltaLite Implementation TODO List

This document outlines the step-by-step tasks for implementing DeltaLite, a miniature version of delta-lake that demonstrates transaction support and log-based architecture without direct Spark dependencies.

## Language Choice Note

DeltaLite is implemented in Scala, despite Delta Kernel being in Java, for the following reasons:
- Delta Lake's original implementation is in Scala
- Scala's features better match Delta Lake's design patterns
- Focus is on learning concepts rather than production connector development
- Functional programming features make implementation cleaner
- Easier transition to understanding actual Delta Lake codebase

## How to Use This TODO List

1. Start from Phase 1 and work through tasks sequentially
2. Check off tasks as you complete them
3. Run tests after completing each task
4. Only move to the next phase after all tests pass
5. Revisit earlier phases if you encounter issues in later tasks
